## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Current Projects

### Game Development in Unity and Gamemaker Studio

I am currently developing a 2-D sidescrolling beat'em up in Gamemaker studio as well as a 2.5D metroidvania style platformer in Unity.

I will also be updating my Github profile with any projects I work on using Python, Java, or C++.

## Current Learnings

### Python and SQL

I am a chemical engineer by degree but I have found that my passion lies in development and as such am self-teaching in Python, C++, SQL, and Java. I have made the commitment to those languages.

## Help outreach

### Resources

I would openly welcome any resources that other self-teachers or professionals in the industry might recommend to me.
